## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
- **Emotional Response**: Trust, confidence, efficiency
- **Design Personality**: Professional yet modern, focusing on clarity and intelligence
- **Visual Metaphors**: Refinement process, data transformation, enhancement
- **Simplicity Spectrum**: Clean, minimal interface that emphasizes the data and results

### Color Strategy
- **Color Scheme Type**: Monochromatic with accent
- **Primary Color**: Deep blue (#0A2472) - communicates trust, professionalism, and intelligence
- **Secondary Colors**: Lighter blue tones (#0E6BA8) for supporting elements
- **Accent Color**: Teal (#06BCC1) for calls-to-action and highlighting important elements
- **Color Psychology**: Blues create a sense of security and professionalism, teal adds a modern touch
- **Color Accessibility**: All color combinations meet WCAG AA standards for contrast
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (light gray #F8F9FA) / Foreground (dark blue-gray #2D3748)
  - Card (white #FFFFFF) / Card-foreground (dark blue-gray #2D3748)
  - Primary (deep blue #0A2472) / Primary-foreground (white #FFFFFF)
  - Secondary (lighter blue #0E6BA8) / Secondary-foreground (white #FFFFFF)
  - Accent (teal #06BCC1) / Accent-foreground (white #FFFFFF)
  - Muted (light gray #F1F3F5) / Muted-foreground (gray #6B7280)

### Typography System
- **Font Pairing Strategy**: Clean sans-serif for both headings and body text, with variation in weight
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear size distinctions between headings and body text
- **Font Personality**: Professional, modern, highly readable
- **Readability Focus**: Generous line height and optimal character count per line
- **Typography Consistency**: Consistent font usage throughout the application
- **Which fonts**: 'Inter' for headings and body text
- **Legibility Check**: Inter is highly legible at various sizes and weights

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
- **Attention Direction**: Visual flow guides users through the authentication → upload → results process
- **White Space Philosophy**: Generous white space to emphasize important elements and create a clean feel
- **Grid System**: 12-column responsive grid for flexible layouts
- **Responsive Approach**: Mobile-first design with breakpoints for tablet and desktop
- **Content Density**: Balanced approach that prioritizes clarity while providing sufficient information

### Animations
- **Purposeful Meaning**: Subtle animations to indicate progress (upload, processing) and transitions
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: More prominent animations for key interactions like successful upload
- **Contextual Appropriateness**: Minimal, business-appropriate animations that don't distract

### UI Elements & Component Selection
- **Component Usage**: Cards for content blocks, shadcn form components for inputs, buttons for actions
- **Component Customization**: Rounded corners, subtle shadows for depth
- **Component States**: Clear visual feedback for hover, active, and disabled states
- **Icon Selection**: Phosphor icons for clarity and consistency
- **Component Hierarchy**: Primary actions emphasized with color and size
- **Spacing System**: Consistent Tailwind spacing with emphasis on comfortable reading
- **Mobile Adaptation**: Stacked layout for mobile, side-by-side for desktop where appropriate

### Visual Consistency Framework
- **Design System Approach**: Component-based design with reusable elements
- **Style Guide Elements**: Colors, typography, spacing, component styles
- **Visual Rhythm**: Consistent spacing between sections and components
- **Brand Alignment**: Professional appearance that instills confidence

### Accessibility & Readability
- **Contrast Goal**: WCAG AA compliance for all text and UI elements

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios
- **Potential Obstacles**: Large file uploads, unsupported file formats, slow networks
- **Edge Case Handling**: Error messages for unsupported formats, upload progress indicators
- **Technical Constraints**: File size limitations, processing time for large datasets

## Implementation Considerations
- **Scalability Needs**: Should handle increasing user base and larger datasets
- **Testing Focus**: Upload reliability, AI refinement accuracy, security of login
- **Critical Questions**: What specific data types need refinement? What constitutes "good" refinement?

## Reflection
- This solution uniquely combines security, ease of use, and AI power in a streamlined workflow
- We've assumed users have specific data refinement needs - this should be validated
- Exceptional results would provide users with not just refined data but insights about the improvements
